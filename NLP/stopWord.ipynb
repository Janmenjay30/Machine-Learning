    "paragraph=\"\"\"\"The Unbending Arc of Justice\"\n",
    "My fellow citizens, my brothers and sisters in the struggle,\n",
    "\n",
    "I do not speak to you today from a palace, nor from a hall of power. I speak from the ground upon which we stand—the common ground of hardship, of hope, and of a hunger for dignity that can no longer be denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look around you. Look into the face of the man beside you. Look into the eyes of the woman who labors next to you. Do you see resignation? Or do you see a fire, long banked, now burning bright with a single, unanswerable question: How long?\n",
    "\n",
    "How long must we wait at the back of the line? How long must we accept the crumbs from a table we helped to build? How long will our children be told they are less, because of the color of their skin, the creed they hold, or the circumstances of their birth?\n",
    "\n",
    "History has brought us to this crossroads. For generations, we have bent our backs. We have turned the other cheek. We have pleaded, and reasoned, and petitioned. And what has been the answer? A deafening silence, broken only by the sound of chains—sometimes of iron, and sometimes of ink and unjust law.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I tell you today, the season of silent suffering is over. The time for patient pleading has passed. We are not here to beg for our rights. We are here to claim them. We are not here to ask for our freedom. We are here to assert it—peacefully, resolutely, and with a force of will that no army can defeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "They call us agitators. They call us troublemakers. Good! Let us trouble the sleep of those who rest comfortably upon a foundation of injustice. Let us agitate the stagnant waters of indifference until they become a mighty flood that washes away the old order.\n",
    "\n",
    "But understand this: Our power does not lie in matching their hatred with our own. That would only make us mirrors of our oppressors. Our power lies in our discipline. Our weapon is truth. Our shield is unity. And our strategy is the unassailable, undeniable force of non-violent resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will fill their jails until their cells become universities of freedom. We will march in numbers so vast they cannot ignore our humanity. We will boycott the engines of an economy that thrives on our degradation. We will speak, and write, and pray, and protest, until the walls of segregation and tyranny crack from the sheer weight of our moral conviction.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be danger. There will be suffering. Some of us may be beaten. Some of us may be jailed. And yes, some of us may be asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. But let no one mistake our suffering for defeat. A wound upon the body of a seeker of justice is a badge of honor, and a scar upon the conscience of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not alone. Across oceans, across continents, the eyes of history are upon us. Future generations are watching. They will ask, \"When the moment came, what did they do?\" Let our answer echo through time: We stood up. We spoke out. We marched forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I say to you now: Do not be afraid. Do not grow weary. The path is long, and the night is dark, but I have seen the mountaintop. I have glimpsed the promised land where our children are judged not by the external, but by the content of their character.\n",
    "\n",
    "That land is not a gift. It is a destination we must reach through our own courage. It is woven from the fabric of our shared struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Join me. Stand with me. March with me. Let us move forward together, with faith in our cause, with love in our hearts for even our opponents, and with an unwavering determination that will bend, at last, the arc of the moral universe toward justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you. Now, let us go, and let us build that future.\"\"\""
